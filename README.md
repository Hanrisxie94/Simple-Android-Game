Once the animation is started, there will be three buttons. The top button lets you start the game, the second one lets you choose the difficulty of the game, and the one at the bottom has a list of reference images.

### Play:
There are 5 * 10 boxes and total 10 zombies (by default). Once user click a box, it could either show it is a hit or a miss. If it is a hit, a zombie will be shown and num of zombie left decrements; if it is a miss, it shows a number to tell user how many zombies left at the row and column corresonding to the box user clicked. Once user finds all zombies, user wins.
